TODO list

* running the program again over previously loaded data
* changing search type (title, band or general)
* user specified desired type of content (chords, tab, bass, ukulele, video or a subset of these)
  -> partly done, but it would be nice, if the scraper's search itself was limited to the options
* user specified output format
* user specified fzf entry format
