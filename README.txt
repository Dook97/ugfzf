=== plaintext > web bloat ==================================

ugfzf will, once it's finished, provide a convenient way to search for
and download chords & tabs from ultimate-guitar.com

I take no responsibility for what you do with the program - using it
is probably against TOS, so it's for research purpouses only *wink*

dependencies:
  * dotnet runtime >= 7.x
  * fzf

If you want to build it yourself, you also need dotnet sdk >= 7.x
