=== plaintext > web bloat ==================================

ugfzf provides a convenient way to search for and download chords and
tabs from the comfort of your terminal window. It uses
ultimate-guitar.com as its source for this data.

Usage is pretty straight forward:

ugfzf [your search query]

...the rest is intuitive, so I trust you'll figure it out on your own.

I take no responsibility for what you do with the program - using it
is probably against TOS, so it's for research purpouses only *wink*

dependencies:
  * dotnet runtime >= 7.x
  * fzf [github.com/junegunn/fzf]

If you want to build it yourself (which at this point you have to),
you also need dotnet sdk >= 7.x
